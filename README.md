## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the API on your local machine:

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and set the following environment variables:

```env
PORT=5000
MongoURI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
```

- `PORT`: The port on which the API will run (default is 5000).
- `MongoURI`: The MongoDB connection URI (use your local MongoDB or a cloud-hosted instance).

### Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the Server

Start the API server:

```bash
npm start
```

The API should now be running locally at `http://localhost:5000`.
